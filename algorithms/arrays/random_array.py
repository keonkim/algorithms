"""
Given a array/list , return a randomly shuffle array/list
this is implementation of "Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle Algorithm",time complexity of this algorithm
is O(n) assumption here is, function rand() that generates random number in O(1) time.

Examples:
Given [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Given [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Given [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]
